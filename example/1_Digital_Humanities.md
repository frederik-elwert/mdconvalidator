# Introduction

**Digital humanities** is an area of research and teaching at the intersection of computing and the disciplines of the [humanities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanities). Developing from the fields of humanities computing, humanistic computing,[^1] and digital humanities praxis[^2] digital humanities embraces a variety of topics, from curating online collections to data mining large cultural data sets. Digital humanities (often abbreviated DH) currently incorporates both digitized and [born-digital](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born-digital) materials and combines the methodologies from traditional humanities disciplines (such as [history](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History), [philosophy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy), [linguistics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics), [literature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature), [art](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art), [archaeology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeology), [music](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music), and [cultural studies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_studies)) and social sciences[^3] with tools provided by [computing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing) (such as [data visualisation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_visualisation), [information retrieval](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval), [data mining](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining), [statistics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics), [text mining](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_mining), [digital mapping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_mapping)), and [digital publishing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_publication). As well, related subfields of digital humanities have emerged like [software studies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_studies), platform studies, and [critical code studies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_code_studies). Digital Humanities also intersects with [new media studies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_media_studies) and [information science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_science) as well as [media theory of composition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_theory_of_composition) and [game studies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_studies), particularly in areas related to digital humanities project design and production.

# Areas of inquiry

Digital humanities scholars use computational methods either to answer existing research questions or to challenge existing theoretical paradigms, generating new questions and pioneering new approaches. One goal is to systematically integrate computer technology into the activities of humanities scholars, [^5] as is done in contemporary empirical [social sciences](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_sciences). Such technology-based activities might include incorporation into the traditional [arts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arts) and [humanities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanities) disciplines use of text-analytic techniques; [GIS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIS); [commons-based peer collaboration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons-based_peer_collaboration); and interactive games and [multimedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimedia).

Despite the significant trend in digital humanities towards networked and multimodal forms of knowledge, spanning social, visual, and haptic media, a substantial amount of digital humanities focuses on documents and text in ways that differentiate the field's work from digital research in [Media studies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_studies), [Information studies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_studies), [Communication studies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_studies), and [Sociology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology). Another goal of digital humanities is to create scholarship than transcends textual sources. This includes the integration of [multimedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimedia), [metadata](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata) and dynamic environments. An example of this is [The Valley of the Shadow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Valley_of_the_Shadow) project at the [University of Virginia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Virginia), the [Vectors Journal of Culture and Technology in a Dynamic Vernacular](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vectors_Journal_of_Culture_and_Technology_in_a_Dynamic_Vernacular) at [University of Southern California](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California) or [Digital Pioneers projects at Harvard](http://pioneers.darthcrimson.org/).

A growing number of researchers in digital humanities are using computational methods for the analysis of large cultural data sets such as the [Google Books](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Books) corpus.[^6] Examples of such projects were highlighted by the Humanities High Performance Computing competition sponsored by the Office of Digital Humanities in 2008,[^7] and also by the Digging Into Data challenge organized in 2009[^8] and 2011[^9] by NEH in collaboration with NSF,[^10] and in partnership with [JISC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Information_Systems_Committee) in the UK, and [SSHRC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Sciences_and_Humanities_Research_Council) in Canada.[^11]

# Environments and tools

Digital humanities is also involved in the creation of software, providing "environments and tools for producing, curating, and interacting with knowledge that is 'born digital' and lives in various digital contexts."[^12] In this context, the field is sometimes known as computational humanities. Many such projects share a "commitment to [open standards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_standards) and [open source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source)."[^13]

# History

Digital humanities descends from the field of humanities computing, of computationally enabled "formal representations of the human record,"[^14] whose origins reach back to the late 1940s in the pioneering work of [Roberto Busa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Busa).[]{#anchor-1}[^15][^16]

Other aspects of digital humanities were descended from the [IRIS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Research_in_Information_and_Scholarship) [Intermedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermedia_%28hypertext%29) project on hypertext at [Brown University](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University) in the 1980s.

The [Text Encoding Initiative](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_Encoding_Initiative), born from the desire to create a standard encoding scheme for humanities electronic texts, is the outstanding achievement of early humanities computing. The project was launched in 1987 and published the first full version of the *TEI Guidelines* in May 1994.[^17]

In the nineties, major digital text and image archives emerged at centers of humanities computing in the U.S. (e.g. the *Women Writers Project*,[^18] the *Rossetti Archive*,[^19] and [*The William Blake Archive*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_William_Blake_Archive)*[^20]*), which demonstrated the sophistication and robustness of text-encoding for literature.[^21] The Blake archive, in particular, was designed by its editors to take advantage of "the syntheses made possible by the electronic medium" and thus accomplish an "editorial transformation" in the publication of Blake's work which was, from the author's hands, multimedia.[^22]

The terminological change from "humanities computing" to "digital humanities" has been attributed to [John Unsworth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Unsworth) and Ray Siemens who, as editors of the monograph *A Companion to Digital Humanities* (2004), tried to prevent the field from being viewed as "mere digitization."[^23] Consequently, the hybrid term has created an overlap between fields like rhetoric and composition, which use "the methods of contemporary humanities in studying digital objects,"[^24] and digital humanities, which uses "digital technology in studying traditional humanities objects".[^25] The use of computational systems and the study of computational media within the arts and humanities more generally has been termed the 'computational turn'.[^26]

In 2006 the [National Endowment for the Humanities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Endowment_for_the_Humanities) (NEH), launched the Digital Humanities Initiative (renamed Office of Digital Humanities in 2008), which made widespread adoption of the term "digital humanities" all but irreversible in the United States.[^27]

Digital humanities emerged from its former niche status and became "big news"[^28] at the 2009 [MLA convention](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Language_Association) in Philadelphia, where digital humanists made "some of the liveliest and most visible contributions"[^29] and had their field hailed as "the first 'next big thing' in a long time."[^30]

# Organizations and Institutions

The field of digital humanities is served by several organisations: [The Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Association_for_Literary_and_Linguistic_Computing) (ALLC), the [Association for Computers and the Humanities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_for_Computers_and_the_Humanities) (ACH), and the [Society for Digital Humanities/Société pour l'étude des médias interactifs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_for_Digital_Humanities) (SDH/SEMI), which are joined under the umbrella organisation of the [Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_of_Digital_Humanities_Organizations) (ADHO). The alliance funds a number of projects such as the [Digital Humanities Quarterly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Humanities_Quarterly), supports the [Text Encoding Initiative](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_Encoding_Initiative), the organisation and sponsoring of workshops and conferences, as well as the funding of small projects, awards and bursaries.[^31]

ADHO also oversees a joint annual conference, which began as the ACH/ALLC (or ALLC/ACH) conference, and is now known as the [Digital Humanities conference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Humanities_conference).

CenterNet is an international network of about 100 digital humanities centers in 19 countries, working together to benefit digital humanities and related fields.[]{#anchor-6}[^32][^33]

# Criticism and controversies

An edited text, ['Debates in the Digital Humanities' (2012)](http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates) has identified a range of criticisms of digital humanities: 'a lack of attention to issues of race, class, gender, and sexuality; a preference for research-driven projects over pedagogical ones; an absence of political commitment; an inadequate level of diversity among its practitioners; an inability to address texts under copyright; and an institutional concentration in well-funded research universities'.[^34]

The literary theorist [Stanley Fish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Fish) claims that the digital humanities pursue a revolutionary agenda and thereby undermine the conventional standards of "pre-eminence, authority and disciplinary power."[^35]

There has also been some recent controversy amongst practitioners of digital humanities around the role that race and/or identity politics plays in digital humanities. Tara McPherson attributes some of the lack of racial diversity in digital humanities to the modality of [UNIX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) and computers, themselves.[^36] An open thread on DHpoco.org recently garnered well over 100 comments on the issue of race in digital humanities, with scholars arguing about the amount that racial (and other) biases affect the tools and texts available for digital humanities research.[^37] This is a current source of debate within the digital humanities.

At present, formal academic recognition of digital work in the humanities remains somewhat problematic, although there are signs that this might be changing.\[[*citation needed*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)\] Some universities offer programs related to the field[^38] and some have dedicated Digital Humanities programmes.[^39]

  number-of-pages: '153'
  abstract: A visionary report on the revitalization of the liberal arts tradition
    in the electronically inflected, design-driven, multimedia language of the twenty-first
    century.Digital\_Humanities is a compact, game-changing report on the state of
    contemporary knowledge production. Answering the question “What is digital humanities?,”
    it provides an in-depth examination of an emerging field. This collaboratively
    authored and visually compelling volume explores methodologies and techniques
    unfamiliar to traditional modes of humanistic inquiry—including geospatial analysis,
    data mining, corpus linguistics, visualization, and simulation—to show their relevance
    for contemporary culture. Written by five leading practitioner-theorists whose
    varied backgrounds embody the intellectual and creative diversity of the field,
    Digital\_Humanities is a vision statement for the future, an invitation to engage,
    and a critical tool for understanding the shape of new scholarship.

    has deeply changed research practice as well as the inter-disciplinary communication
    and is likely to do so in future. The introduction to the HSR Focus presents the
    collected contributions, which address a twofold conceptual challenge. In a first
    part, problems and chances of a contemporary history of digital media are discussed.
    In the second part the authors leave the level of conceptual considerations and
    turn towards the already established practice of digitization and the supply of
    sources in the net.
